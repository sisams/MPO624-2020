### Questions 

1. When did Pascal and Laplace write their great works on probability? How about Bayes? 

1. What formula relates the probability of two events to the probability of each event, if they are **independent**? 

1. What defines **independence**?

1. In your own words, what is the frequentist interpretation of probability? 

1. In your own words, what is the Bayesian interpretation of probability? 

1. In Bayesian statistics, what are *prior* and *evidence* and *posterior*? Write Bayes' theorem and define the symbols you use, perhaps with an example. How does it relate to the scientific method of a cycle from hypothesis to experiment and on to better hypothesis? 

1. What is a probability distribution? a probability density? (hint: discrete vs. continuous). What are the units of p(T), the probability density of temperature of some object at some time? 

1. Using the term *likelihood* for probability density, what is the *maximum likelihood* value of T if p(T) is not symmetric -- the mean, the median, or the mode? Sketch a nonsymmetric distribution and indicate these 3 different measures of its *central tendency*. 

1. Consider a uniform distribution over [1,2]. What is its first *moment*? What are its first four *central moments*? 

1. What fundamental mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) creates the *Normal distribution* according to the *Central Limit Theorem*? Can you think of reasons it is so commonly observed? That is, can you name some natural processes that mimic that mathematical operation? 

1. In your own words, what is a *test statistic*? 

1. What is the Z-test (based on the Z-statistic)? What are the one-tailed (or one-sided) p-values for Z values of 1, 2, 3? (sometimes called *one-sigma, two-sigma, three-sigma* events or excursions of a variable away from its mean). 

1. What is the t-test, based on the t-distribution? Find a table or Web page to answer the p-value question above, for a t-test with sample number N=10. How small is the difference from a Z-test?

1. What is the chi-squared distribution? When might you use it in a statistical test? (hint: where in science do we see a sum of squares involving just two or three variables?)

1. What is the F-test? Where have we seen a *ratio of variances* before? (hint: what was r-squared in linear regression)? 

1. What are the *joint* PDF (probability density or distribution function)? *marginal*? *conditional*? Illustrate these 3 quantities with a sketch or annotation on an example like at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution.
